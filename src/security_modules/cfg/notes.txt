cfgMasterXML.py
  This python program is designed to either:
     decompose a single .xml file into a hierarchy of entries, or recompose said 
     .xml file from said hierarchy.
     options are :
         [-x xmlFile ] [ -d xmlDir ] -[s|j]
         where:
            -x xmlFile      option name to use as the xmlFile (default is 
                            security-modules.xml)
            -d xmlDir       optional name to use as the directory holding 
                            components of/for xmlFile
            -s              split xmlFile in to components stored in xmlDir
            -j              join components in xmlDir to a single xml file in 
                            xmlFile
            
    Note that the tool will *not* overwrite either the default xmlFile name or 
    default xmlDir name
    


sort_security_modules_by_name.xsl
    This xslt takes a master modules file (for example, security-modules.xml) 
    and sorts it so that the module groups are in orders, and the modules 
    themselves are in order within each group.  The default is to sort by the 
    actual name of the module, but by tweaking which line is commented out you 
    can sort by libraryname
    
    To execute, type 'xsltproc sort_modules_by_name.xsl XML_FILE_NAME'
