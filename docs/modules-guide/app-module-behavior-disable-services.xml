 <title>Disabling Services</title>
 <para> Several modules included with OS Lockdown simply disable a service in order to reduce the systemâ€™s attack
  surface. Each module performs its actions much the same way with the exception of the service and package associated
  with the service. </para>

  <title>Solaris 10: DISA UNIX STIGS - SRR Scripts may report a failure</title>
  <para> OS Lockdown uses the <command>svcadm(1M)</command> command to disable services to include the
    <command>inetd(1M)</command> daemon. Many legacy services such as <command>telnetd(1M)</command> and
    <command>in.ftpd(1M)</command> are dependent on <command>inetd(1M)</command>. Even though OS Lockdown disables these
   legacy services, a system reboot may leave some of these services in an <emphasis>uninitialized</emphasis> state
   because they are dependent on the <command>inetd(1M)</command> daemon; which has been disabled. </para>
  <para> The System Readiness Review (SRR) scripts only checks to see if the service is in an
    <emphasis>offline</emphasis> or <emphasis>disabled</emphasis> state. If you manually enable
    <command>inetd(1M)</command> with <command>svcadm enable inetd</command> and then disable it with <command>svcadm
    disable inetd</command>, the uninitialized services should switch to <emphasis>disabled</emphasis>. This is a false
   positive and the OS Lockdown team will be working with DISA to resolve. </para>
  <para> Tip: You can use the <command>inetadm(1M)</command> command to list all services dependent on the
    <command>inetd(1M)</command> daemon. </para>
