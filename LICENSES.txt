The OS Lockdown source code is licensed under a combination of licenses.  All 
pieces except the Console (code under the console subdirectory) are licensed 
under the terms of the GPLv3.  The OS Lockdown Console uses the Grails web 
framework licensed under the terms of the Apache V2 license and code generated 
by Grails is assumed to have this license as well.  All Forcepoint changes are 
covered under the terms of the GPLv3 license, as are any files written 
entirely by Forcepoint.

The Console uses several javascript libraries that are included with the 
OS Lockdown sources.  All Forcepoint changes to these javascript libraries 
are covered under the GPLv3 license.  The libraries, their associated 
licenses, and the reason the libraries are include rather than downloaded
 are as follows:
  Taconite v2.0 - licensed under the Apache V2 license.
		- multiple Forcepoint changes to work with our code
  jquery-corners.js v0.3 - dual licensed under the MIT and GPLv2 license.
		- no real 'home' to download this version from
  jquery-blockUI.js v2.37 - dual licensed under the MIT and GPLv2 license.
		- no real 'home' to download this version from

The process of building OS Lockdown from this source will involve 
download additional projects, which may be licensed under the same or 
different licenses.
