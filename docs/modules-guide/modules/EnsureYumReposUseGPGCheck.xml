 <para>
  The <filename>yum</filename> package manager used by most Red Hat
  derived Linux distributions has the ability to require that all
  packages in a repository must have a valid GPG signature before they
  can be installed. This provides an additional measure of security by
  not allowing packages to be installed unless it is signed with the
  approved key.
