 <para>
  Configures the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon to synchronize time.
  This module ensures the <filename>ntp.conf(5)</filename> configuration
  file matches the contents provided, the NTP daemon is configured to
  start during system startup, and is currently running.

 <para>
  Time synchronization is <emphasis role="italics">critical</emphasis>
  to accurate logging and correlating events. It is strongly recommended
  that the NTP daemon documentation be reviewed and use this module to
  deploy a consistent configuration across the enterprise.
 </para>
 <para>
  The default installation of the NTP daemon software for many operating
  systems points to an external time source. If your machines do not
  have Internet access, it is recommended to configure one or more of
  your own servers to function as time servers. You can then use this
  module to configure other servers to point to your designated time
  servers.
